# Token's Logo is not showing up


**Logos need to be image URLS that end in .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif file extensions.  
  
Logos should be at max in 256x256 file dimensions.**

Example [http://i.epvpimg.com/iYx2cab.png](http://i.epvpimg.com/iYx2cab.png)

**If URLS don't end in the correct file extension they will not load!**

I can recommend you this service, there you got the possibility to choose the "direct link"

{% embed url="https://epvpimg.com/" %}
