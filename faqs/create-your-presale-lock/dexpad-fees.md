# DexPad Fees?

**The fees of our Platform are different on every Chain, so it's hard to generalize them.**

**Just visit our website and select the Product you want to use and you'll see the price.**

## **2% Fee for Rebalancing?**

With the v2.9+ Update we were forced to ask our customers to deposit more tokens than required.

_**The UniV2 Provider/Fork has a bug which stops all tokens from adding liquidity with the given price, this is why we have to take for now the 2% additional fee in Tokens..**_**.**

We don't have any access to these Tokens, and the amount we don't need is burnt.

## 2% Platform Fees in Tokens?

Additional to the value of the native chain token we charge 2% of the tokens you sold on our platform.

These 2% are used for our revenue model, the BuyBackAndBurn, if you want to know more about it you can read it up here :\) [https://docs.dexpad.io/native-token/buy-back-and-burn](https://docs.dexpad.io/native-token/buy-back-and-burn)
