# How to Start a Presale?

_**If you want to start a presale make sure you know and understand your sourcecode \(Only if you are not using DexPad Standard Token Minter\).**_

**Here is a Checklist for what to do before starting:**

1. I understand the Functions of my Contract.
2. I did disable all special transfer functions in my contract \(Specially if its Liquidity generator token like SafeMoon\).
3. I disabled all fees or anything similar while I do my presale \(Specially if its Liquidity generator token like SafeMoon\).
4. If I limit the Max Tokens per Wallet or Max Transaction Amount I did set this to 100% of my supply.
5. **I didn't renounce ownership of my contract.**
6. I am aware of what Liquidity is.
7. **I didn't add Tokens to the DEX already \(THIS IS MUST, Otherwise Presale Will Fail\).**
